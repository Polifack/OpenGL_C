NORIA:

leftmouse+drag -> rotate on x axis
leftmouse+shift+drag -> rotate on y axis (i could not do it with alt because of my window manager switched workspaces on alt)

key_r -> change rotation
key_s -> stop rotation

rightmouse -> open menu
		-- change speed
		-- change color
		-- exit


FILES: 

v3: auxiliar 'class' to manage vectors
glaux: auxiliar functions because opengl ones are ugly
transform: auxiliar function to store position, angles, rotation, anchor point and scale 
gameobject: represents any 'item' to be rendered storing the drawing function and the transform to that object

main: main file that creates and renders the noria
